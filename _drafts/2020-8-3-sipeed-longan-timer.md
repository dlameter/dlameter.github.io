## Initial Project Goals
These are the goals I started the project with:
* Create a timer with a quick reset proceedure that can be used without a smart device.
* Learn about communication with the OLED screen.
* Implement communication with the OLED screen.
* Learn how to navigate datasheet type documentation.
* Practice building applications for deployment on an embedded device.

## Successes and failures of the project
Sucesses:
* Created timer that fit use cases.
* Learn about communication with the OLED screen.
* Learned to navigate datasheet type documentation.
* Practice with building embedded applications.

Failures:
* Implementing communication with the OLED screen.

## Documentation used
List links to documentation that can help others looking for help with this board.
