title: "My First Post!"

Welcome to my site! This is the start of a portfolio of projects and topics I find intriguing. I hope to place descriptions and demos of projects as well as how I went about writting/building them. These projects bring me joy and I hope I can inspire you to go down the rabit hole of what interests you!

At this point the site is simple and bare. That is the look I am looking to achieve, but not quite this simple. I hope to animate the site more and make portions pop (and finish things like the sidebar). The site itself is only a means to an end currently and is not supposed to be the focus of a lot of my time.

I hope you enjoy the posts to come!
